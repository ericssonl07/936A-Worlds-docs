This class represents a group of motors and provides methods for controlling their behavior. It allows for easy manipulation of multiple motors as a single unit, including spinning, stopping, and resetting their positions. The class also provides methods for checking the connection status of the motors and calculating their average position.

\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class represents a group of motors and provides methods for controlling their behavior. It allows for easy manipulation of multiple motors as a single unit, including spinning, stopping, and resetting their positions. The class also provides methods for checking the connection status of the motors and calculating their average position.

The \doxylink{class_motor_group}{Motor\+Group} class is designed to work with a set of motors, allowing for easy control and management of multiple motors at once. It provides methods for adding motors to the group, spinning them at a specified velocity, and stopping them. The class also includes methods for resetting the positions of the motors and checking their connection status. Provided the external ratio and wheel radius, the class can calculate the motor\textquotesingle{}s internal (raw), shaft, and wheel properties (e.\+g., velocity, position). \begin{DoxyAttention}{Attention}
The class expects that all managed devices have the same external ratio and radius, and that they are coupled (e.\+g., in a typical VEX \mbox{[}non-\/\+XDrive\mbox{]} base).
\end{DoxyAttention}
The class also expects external ratios to be given as the ratio of output spin to input spin. For instance, if the motor spins 6 times for every 1 turn of the wheel, the external ratio should be set to 1/6 as the external wheel turns 1/6 times for every 1 turn of the motor. There is no need to account for the cartridge, which vex\+::motor does automatically. \begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The \doxylink{class_motor_group}{Motor\+Group} class is implemented using a vector to store the motors, allowing for dynamic addition and removal of motors. The class provides a flexible interface for controlling the motors, making it easy to integrate into various robotics applications. Internally, it is essentially a wrapper around the \doxylink{class_motor}{Motor} class, providing additional functionality for managing multiple motors.
