The \doxylink{class_motor}{Motor} class is designed to work with a VEX motor and provides methods for spinning the motor, resetting its position, and checking its connection status. It allows for easy manipulation of the motor\textquotesingle{}s speed, voltage, and position. The class is an abstraction on top of vex\+::motor that accounts for gear ratios. \begin{DoxyAttention}{Attention}
The gear ratio is expected to be given as the ratio of output spin to input spin. For instance, if the motor spins 6 times for every 1 turn of the wheel, the external ratio should be set to 1/6 as the external wheel turns 1/6 times for every 1 turn of the motor. There is no need to account for the cartridge, which vex\+::motor does automatically.
