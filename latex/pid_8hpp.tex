\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The \doxylink{class_p_i_d}{PID} controller is a control loop feedback mechanism widely used in industrial control systems. It calculates an "{}error"{} value as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable. The controller attempts to minimize the error by adjusting the process control inputs. The \doxylink{class_p_i_d}{PID} controller consists of three namesake components\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Proportional\+: The proportional term produces an output value that is proportional to the current error value.
\item Integral\+: The integral term is concerned with the accumulation of past errors. If the error has been present for a long time, the integral term will increase, leading to a larger output.
\item Derivative\+: The derivative term is a prediction of future error based on its rate of change. The greater the present rate of change, the more the derivative term will resist the change, preventing overshoot.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyNote}
The traditional \doxylink{class_p_i_d}{PID} controller suffers from a few issues\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Integral windup\+: When the controller is saturated, the integral term can accumulate a large error, leading to overshoot.
\item Termination conditions\+: The controller may not be able to determine when it has arrived at the target.
\item Inefficiency at startup\+: The controller is usually not very efficient at startup, and a bang-\/bang controller is often better initially.
\end{DoxyItemize}

This implementation of the \doxylink{class_p_i_d}{PID} controller includes several features to address these issues (mainly integral windup)\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Activation threshold\+: The controller activates below a certain error threshold; above this threshold, the output is set to the maximum value.
\item Integration threshold\+: The integral term is not accumulated when the error is above this threshold. Addresses integral windup. In the Wikipedia article (see below), this is referred to as "{}conditional integration."{}
\item Derivative threshold\+: The controller is not considered to have arrived when the derivative exceeds this threshold. Addresses termination conditions-\/ a system that has small error but large derivative is likely "{}sweeping"{} past the target and not actually arrived.
\item Maximum integral\+: The integral term is limited to a maximum value. Addresses integral windup.
\item Gamma\+: The integral term is decayed by a factor of gamma each timestep so it "{}forgets"{} past errors gradually. Addresses integral windup.
\item Deactivate integral on error sign change\+: The integral term is reset when the error sign changes. Thus when the system sweeps past the target, the integral term is reset to zero so it doesn\textquotesingle{}t keep pushing the system in the wrong direction. Addresses integral windup. In the Wikipedia article, this is referred to as "{}\+Clegg integration."{}
