Here is a list of all documented files with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\mbox{\hyperlink{chassis_8hpp}{chassis.\+hpp}} \\*This class represents a basic chassis for a robot, providing methods for controlling its movement and tracking its position }{\pageref{chassis_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\mbox{\hyperlink{execution__graph_8hpp}{execution\+\_\+graph.\+hpp}} \\*Experimental class for managing chains of function calls with support for delays, parallel execution, branching, and chaining }{\pageref{execution__graph_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\mbox{\hyperlink{matrix_8hpp}{matrix.\+hpp}} \\*This class represents a matrix and provides various operations for matrix manipulation, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion. It also includes methods for row operations, transposition, and finding the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of the matrix. The class is designed to be flexible and efficient, allowing for easy manipulation of matrices of different sizes and types. The \doxylink{class_matrix}{Matrix} class is implemented using a 2D vector to store the matrix elements, and it provides methods for accessing and modifying individual elements. The class also includes methods for setting the output precision for displaying matrix elements, as well as methods for creating identity matrices, zero matrices, and one matrices. The class is designed to be used in a variety of applications, including linear algebra, numerical analysis, and scientific computing. Here, the specific usage is for solving a Cubic Spline Interpolation problem, where the matrix is used to represent the system of equations that arise from the interpolation process }{\pageref{matrix_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\mbox{\hyperlink{motor_8hpp}{motor.\+hpp}} \\*This class represents a motor and provides methods for controlling its behavior }{\pageref{motor_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\mbox{\hyperlink{motor__group_8hpp}{motor\+\_\+group.\+hpp}} \\*This class represents a group of motors and provides methods for controlling their behavior. It allows for easy manipulation of multiple motors as a single unit, including spinning, stopping, and resetting their positions. The class also provides methods for checking the connection status of the motors and calculating their average position }{\pageref{motor__group_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\mbox{\hyperlink{odometry_8hpp}{odometry.\+hpp}} \\*This class represents an odometry system for a robot, providing methods for tracking its position and orientation }{\pageref{odometry_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\mbox{\hyperlink{path_8hpp}{path.\+hpp}} \\*This struct represents a 2D coordinate point with x and y values }{\pageref{path_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\mbox{\hyperlink{pid_8hpp}{pid.\+hpp}} \\*This class implements a customized \doxylink{class_p_i_d}{PID} (Proportional-\/\+Integral-\/\+Derivative) controller for controlling a system }{\pageref{pid_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\mbox{\hyperlink{pursuit_8hpp}{pursuit.\+hpp}} \\*This class implements a pure pursuit algorithm for path following in robotics }{\pageref{pursuit_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\mbox{\hyperlink{vex_8h_source}{vex.\+h}} }{\pageref{vex_8h_source}}{}
