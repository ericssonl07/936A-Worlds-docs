The \doxylink{class_odometry}{Odometry} class is designed to work with a set of 2 tracking wheels and an inertial sensor. Work is in progress to add support for all tracking configurations.

The class manages its own thread for tracking and displaying the position. Display is currently comment out. The tracking thread updates every 50ms. \begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The class uses the readings from the tracking wheels and the inertial sensor to calculate the robot\textquotesingle{}s position and orientation. It utilizes the assumption of "{}local circularity"{} (think "{}local linearity"{} in calculus) to simplify the geometry into circular arcs. Then, by choosing a convenient coordinate system offset from global by robot heading + change in heading \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} 0.\+5, we can find the actual change globally. 
\end{DoxyNote}
\begin{DoxyAttention}{Attention}
The class expects an IMU sensor that is calibrated and properly aligned with the robot\textquotesingle{}s frame of reference (all offsets accounted for in the vex\+::inertial constructor).
\end{DoxyAttention}
Additionally, the IMU should follow mathematical convention of positive rotations being counter-\/clockwise. Set this using the vex\+::turn\+Type\+::left specifier in the vex\+::inertial constructor (see example usage).

This class is not intended to be used directly-\/ {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_odometry}{Odometry}} itself is managed by the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_chassis}{Chassis}} class. Though in theory, it could be used independently, it is not recommended to preserve the modularity and cleanness of the code.
