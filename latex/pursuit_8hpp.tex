The \doxylink{class_pursuit}{Pursuit} class is designed to follow a given path using the pure pursuit algorithm. It calculates the target point on the path based on the robot\textquotesingle{}s current position and orientation. Then, based on the relative position of the target point and the robot\textquotesingle{}s orientation and geometry, it calculates the steering angle required to follow the path in the form of a pair of left/right voltages. Additionally, \doxylink{class_pursuit}{Pursuit} provides the radius of the osculating circle to the target point, which can be used for dynamic velocity control based on centripetal acceleration.
